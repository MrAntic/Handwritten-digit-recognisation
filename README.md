This is my script for handwritten digit recognition competition on Kaggle.<br/>
It uses a simple CNN with 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers (including final softmax layer).<br/>

Directory Structure:<br/>

main.py : Contains the model, training and testing part.<br/>

digit-recognizer/ : Should contain train.csv and test.csv files.<br/>

Training Accuracy: **99.91%** (on 40000 images) <br/>
Validation Accuracy: **99.45%** (on 2000 images) <br/>
Test Accuracy: **99.44%** (on 28000 images) <br/>
